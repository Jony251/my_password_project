<h2>The Diceware Passphrase</h2>

Write code that creates a password using the Diceware method.\
There is a text file in which each line has a 5-digit number and\
some word corresponds to this number.(Check the file "txt.diceware").\
Your password consists of 6 words from this list. To get a random word,\
throw a die 5 times and add up the results to get one whole number. \
Then, find the word in the list that corresponds to this number and add\
it to our password. For example, if the dice throws yield the following\
values: 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, then one should look in the list for the word that\
corresponds to the value 13355 (e.g., "spurn") and add it to the password.\
The password should consist of 6 words that we got after 30 rolls.

For example: "nicetycarryvichyabbotwhignewt". After creating a new password,\
it must be displayed on the screen.
